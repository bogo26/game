# Horde Crawler (working title)

1–4 player **local co-op** top-down pixel-art horde crawler for **macOS and Windows**. Pick a hero, fight through hordes of up to 300 enemies, and upgrade on every level-up.

Design, controls, heroes and architecture: [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Requirements

- [Godot 4.7](https://godotengine.org/download), standard build (not .NET)

## Running

```bash
./tools/dev.sh run      # play
./tools/dev.sh editor   # open in the Godot editor
./tools/dev.sh test     # headless test suite
```

- `tools/dev.sh` looks for Godot in `/Applications`, `~/Applications` and `~/Downloads`. Set `GODOT=/path/to/Godot` to override.
- On Windows, run the same commands from Git Bash, or call Godot directly:

```bash
godot --headless --path . --import
godot --headless --path . -s res://tests/run_tests.gd
```

- Press **F3** in game for the performance overlay (FPS, frame times, per-system costs).
